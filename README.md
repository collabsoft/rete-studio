**Rete.js application**

## Introduction

Rete Studio is a general-purpose code generation tool powered by Rete.js. Its primary goal is to seamlessly bridge the gap between textual and visual programming languages. With Rete Studio, you can transform a textual programming language into a visual representation, which can then be transformed back into textual language.

## Key features

- **Core**: basic interfaces and methods for graph transformation
- **Languages**: transformation of specific programming languages into graphs and vice versa
- **UI**: components for visualizing the node editor and code editor
- **Demo**: application featuring Playground (shown on the screenshot)

## Roadmap

Currently, JavaScript is the only supported language. Considering the complexity of the transformation process, our current priority is building [a robust application](https://studio.retejs.org/). Once we have fine-tuned our methodologies and algorithms (including different programming languages), we will introduce them as a published plugin for Rete.js.
